*                        RACFADM - Standards                          *
*---------------------------------------------------------------------*

  The following standards have been put in place, in hopes of making
  RACFADM easier to use and maintain:

  1) Panels
     - Member names
         $$DIR ...... Directory of all members and description
         $??????? ... Data/informational ($CHANGES, $ISSUES, etc.)
         #??????? ... Tutorials
         RACF???? ... Menu, data entry and table panels
       Where ? can be anything
     - Code
       -- At the bottom of the panel are comments documenting
          items of interest
       -- All panels allow invocation of a tutorial panel
     - Main menu
       -- Number entries (1-99) are designated for obtaining,
          displaying/changing the RACF database (Userids,
          Groups, etc.) and customizing the utility (Settings)
       -- Alphabetic entries (A-Z) are used to assist in maintaining
          or documenting RACFADM
       -- The RACFMENU panel is a primary option menu so one can use
          the jump function to go directly to any RACFMENU option
       -- All entries are point-n-shoot fields
     - Tables
       -- Panels displaying tables
          * Primary commands SORT, LOCATE, ONLY and RESET are
            available and operate in the same manner
            o When possible the RESET command will allow changing
              the filter criteria, by passing it a text string as
              a parameter
          * The SORTed column is the color turquois and un-sorted
            columns are green
          * The LOCATE command operates on the SORTed column
          * Column headers are point-n-shoot sort fields
            o Can place cursor on column header and press ENTER
            o It will sort the column ascending order the 1st time,
              and if accomplished again, will sort the column in
              descending order (some fields may be reversed, due the
              column is already sorted in ascending order)

  2) REXX
     - Member names
         $$DIR ...... Directory of all members and description
         RACF???? ... REXX programs, where ???? can be anything
     - Code
       -- Changes are documented by commenting/using a flag character
          * '/* @?? */' in columns 62-71
            o Where ??, 1st character is A-Z, and 2nd character is
              is 1-9, then A-Z
            o Also, the flag character is documented in the comment
              box at the top of the program, most current at the top
          * Example:
              /*------------------------------------------------------*
              /* FLG  YYMMDD  USERID   DESCRIPTION                    *
              /* ---  ------  -------  -------------------------------*
              /* @A1  200420  RACFA    Obtain REXX pgm name           *
              /* @A0  200419  RACFA    Created REXX                   *
              /*======================================================*
              parse source . . REXXPGM .                     /* @A1 */
              REXXPGM  = LEFT(REXXPGM,8)                     /* @A1 */
       -- A comment box is coded above each subroutine, documenting
          the purpose of the code
       -- All REXX programs allow:
          * Viewing and logging the RACF commands and the return code,
            by changing the Settings (Option 0) 'RACF commands' field
          * Tracing the REXX program, by changing the Settings
            (Option 0) 'REXX trace' field
          * The capability to have the user control how they want
            to display any files/reports by changing the Settings
            (Option 0) 'Display files' field to Browse, Edit or View

  3) Settings
     - The following are the naming standard for variables used to
       save the user's Settings (Option 0)
       -- Syntax
            SET#????
       -- Where
            SET  ... Settings (Option 0)
            #    ... G=General, M=Management and T=Adding TSO Userid
            ???? ... Field name
